# How Can I Contribute?

## Bug Reports

Guidelines for bug reports:

- Use the github issue search - check if the issue is already reported.
- Check if the issue has been fixed - try to reproduce it using the lastest master or development branch in the repo.
- isolate the problem - So the community doesn't have hard times finding the possible bug.

## Labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues.    
Here's what they represent and how we use them:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| bug  | This is used for marking verified bugs.|
| duplicate| This is used to marked duplicated issue reports.|
| High Priority| This is used to mark things that needs to be done ASAP.|
| In progress | This is used for issues where the developers currently work on.|
| invalid | This is used for incorrect reports |
| question | This is used for reports where developers ask things to each other or to the issue creator.|
| wontfix | is used for things that doesn't fix at the moment. But later in the dev process.|

## Pull Requests

- **Feature requests** first need to be discussed and accepted [through an issue](https://github.com/FiveM-Scripts/SecurityVans/issues/new) before sending in a pull request.
- Pull requests will be merged after being reviewed.
- Please be respectful to other contributors and hold to [The Code Manifesto](http://codemanifesto.com/)
